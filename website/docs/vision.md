# Vision & Manifesto

Git-Ape is the implementation of a thesis Microsoft published in March 2026: **[Platform Engineering for the Agentic AI Era](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/all-things-azure/platform-engineering-for-the-agentic-ai-era/)**. This page summarizes the thesis and shows where each idea is implemented in the codebase.

## The shift

For a decade, platform engineering relied on humans translating intent into machine-safe API calls — through CLIs, SDKs, pipelines, wrappers, and UI workflows.

    end

    classDef step fill:#e2e8f0,stroke:#475569,color:#0f172a
    class H1,L1,L2,L3 step
```

AI agents collapse that stack. They ingest natural language, reason over API schemas, generate and validate IaC, and apply changes through provider APIs — all while enforcing guardrails and approvals inline.

```

> **Agents don't bypass APIs — they bypass humans as API translators.** The interaction layer becomes implicit, dynamically constructed by the agent using API specs, provider schemas, and organizational controls.

## What Git-Ape is

Git-Ape is an **agent + policy** platform-engineering framework for Azure, built on GitHub Copilot. It is an alternative to module-first IaC platforms, designed to deploy any Azure workload from natural-language intent.

| Module-first platform | Git-Ape (agents + policy) |
|---|---|
| 50+ Terraform/Bicep modules to maintain | One agent, many compiled outputs |
| Last year's API surface | Reads live Azure REST API specs ([azure-rest-api-reference](/docs/skills/azure-rest-api-reference)) |
| Static `README.md` per module | Living docs generated at conversation time |
| "Update 50 modules when standards change" | "Update the agent's context" |
| Compliance enforced at PR review | Compliance enforced at generation, plan, and runtime |

## How it works — three layers of enforcement

The manifesto's central claim is that compliance is no longer a gate you pass through — it is **inherent in the process**. Git-Ape implements that with three enforcement layers:

%%{init: {'theme':'base','themeVariables':{'fontSize':'13px','lineColor':'#64748b','textColor':'#1e293b','primaryTextColor':'#0f172a','edgeLabelBackground':'#f8fafc'}}}%%

    end

```

### Generation layer

Git-Ape skills enforce policy **before** any IaC is written:

- **[`azure-naming-research`](/docs/skills/azure-naming-research)** — looks up CAF abbreviations and validates names against Azure constraints
- **[`azure-rest-api-reference`](/docs/skills/azure-rest-api-reference)** — reads the live Azure REST API specs so generated templates use correct properties and the latest stable API versions
- **[`azure-security-analyzer`](/docs/skills/azure-security-analyzer)** — blocks Critical and High security findings before deployment
- **[`azure-role-selector`](/docs/skills/azure-role-selector)** — recommends least-privilege roles instead of broad Contributor grants

### Plan / static-analysis layer

When a PR is opened, **[`git-ape-plan.yml`](/docs/workflows/git-ape-plan)** runs Checkov, ARM-TTK, PSRule, Template Analyzer, plus `az deployment what-if`. Non-compliant code is blocked before merge. See [Security Analysis](/docs/use-cases/security-analysis).

### Runtime layer

Even after merge, **[`azure-policy-advisor`](/docs/skills/azure-policy-advisor)** assesses your templates against Azure Policy initiatives (CIS Azure Foundations v3.0, NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5) and Azure Policy denies or audits non-compliant deployments at the control plane.

## What does not change

The fundamentals remain:

- **Provider APIs** are still the ultimate source of truth.
- **Human accountability** remains essential. Git-Ape never deploys without explicit user confirmation, and CI/CD deploys require PR approval.
- **IaC** is still the deterministic, versioned, reviewable execution format. It is not eliminated — it becomes a **compiled artifact** generated from higher-order inputs.

What changes is your **system of record**. Architecture artifacts (ADRs, reference patterns, security baselines, naming conventions) become the governing ledger. The agent's execution trace — saved in [`.azure/deployments/`](/docs/deployment/state) — is the binding evidence between intent and outcome.

## The new artifacts the platform team produces

Quoting the manifesto:

> The module registry isn't dead — but it's no longer the centre of gravity. **The new artifact is the agent.** Policies, context documents, and examples become inputs the agent consumes. The agent itself is what the platform team produces — versioned, tested, and deployed like any other software.

In Git-Ape this maps to:

| Concept | Where it lives in the repo |
|---|---|
| Repo-level instructions | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` |
| Reusable skills | [`.github/skills/`](/docs/skills/overview) |
| Custom agents | [`.github/agents/`](/docs/agents/overview) |
| CI/CD enforcement | [`.github/workflows/`](/docs/workflows/overview) |
| Execution trace | [`.azure/deployments/`](/docs/deployment/state) |

## Who this changes things for

The manifesto identifies four shifts that map directly to the audiences Git-Ape serves:

| Shift | Audience | Where to read more |
|---|---|---|
| Interaction shifts from syntax to intent | **[Engineers](/docs/personas/for-engineers)** describe what they need in natural language | [Deploy anything](/docs/use-cases/deploy-anything) |
| Guardrails move into the agent | **[Platform engineers](/docs/personas/for-platform-engineering)** ship agents and skills, not module catalogues | [Skills overview](/docs/skills/overview) |
| Compliance is inherent in the process | **[Executives](/docs/personas/for-executives)** get continuous compliance evidence, not point-in-time audits | [Security Analysis](/docs/use-cases/security-analysis) |
| Drift remediation becomes continuous | **[DevOps & SRE](/docs/personas/for-devops)** detect drift, propose fixes, request approval, apply remediations | [Drift Detection](/docs/deployment/drift-detection) |

## What's next

This implementation covers Azure ARM today, with an explicit roadmap toward Bicep and Terraform compatibility, code-to-cloud security with Defender for Cloud, and day-2 operations through Azure SRE Agent.
